# OpenLiteSpeed For DirectAdmin
This is a project aimed to bring OpenLiteSpeed Web Server to DirectAdmin with reduced features.
It is still in mind. So what do I want to reach? 
1.User level
Like the Virtual Host option in OLS admin.
Write configs and make an auto-complete script to generate configure files.
2.Admin level
Direct it to the lsws control panel.
